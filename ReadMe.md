## Talk on &ldquo;Reproducible research&rdquo;

These are slides for a talk that I gave for the Molecular Microbial
Ecology and Evolution (MoMiEE) group at UW-Madison on 11 May 2015, at
the annual retreat for the
[Center for Genome Dynamics](http://cgd.jax.org/),
[Jackson Lab](http://www.jax.org/), 28 May 2015, and for the
[Summer Institute for Training in Biostatistics (SIBS)](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/content/summer-institute-training-biostatistics-sibs)
at UW-Madison, on 9 July 2015. It was revised a bit each time.

The compiled slides:
